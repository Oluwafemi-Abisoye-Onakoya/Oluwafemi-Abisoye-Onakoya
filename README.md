# 👋 Hi there, I’m Oluwafemi Onakoya!

Welcome to my GitHub space – where **finance meets data** and ideas become insights.

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a curious explorer in the world of data, finance, and technology. As a CIMA-qualified Management Accountant with a growing passion for data engineering and analytics, I love transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. My passion lies in blending **finance acumen** with **data analytics** to drive smarter, faster business decisions.

I’m currently expanding my capabilities into data engineering and BI, one project and tool at a time.
